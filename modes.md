##Matching Extbans
Matching extended bans can be used with channel modes +b, +e, and +I in place of the normal nick!user@host argument.  

| Extban | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| r:realname | Matches users with the specified real name (gecos). Can also be used with channel mode +I. |
| R:account | Matches a specified services account. (Note: A services account name can be different from the user's nickname.) Can also be used with channel mode +I. |

##Acting Extbans
Acting extended bans can be used with channel modes +b and +e as a prefix to the nick!user@host argument.  Descriptions assume that the extban is being used as a ban (channel mode +b), which will prevent the specified user from performing an action.  When extbans are used in a ban exception (channel mode +e), they allow the specified user to perform an action or bypass a restriction.

| Extban | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| A: | Prevents the specified user from inviting other users to the channel. |
| c: | Blocks messages containing color or control codes from the specified user. |
| C: | Blocks CTCPs to the channel from the specified user (except ACTION). |
| m: | Prevents the specified user from speaking in the channel. |
| N: | Prevents the specified user from changing their nickname while in the channel. |
| S: | Strips color and control codes from the specified user's messages. |
| T: | Blocks channel notices from the specified user. |
